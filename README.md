# sudoku_solver

Author: Patricio Araya

This is a n-sudoku solver implemeted in C++ for HPC course at UCN.

The program read an imput grid from a .csv file and solve the sudoku printing the time it needed to do so.

# TODO:
  - implement parallel solution and speed up analysis.
(the current algorithm implements a parallel solution to eliminate unnecessary answer before the backtraking process, but the speed up gain is minimal)
